          <h2>Missle Man of India</h2>
          <p>
            In 2002 India’s ruling National Democratic Alliance (NDA) put
            forward Kalam to succeed outgoing President Kocheril Raman
            Narayanan. Kalam was nominated by the Hindu nationalist (Hindutva)
            NDA even though he was Muslim, and his stature and popular appeal
            were such that even the main opposition party, the Indian National
            Congress, also proposed his candidacy. Kalam easily won the election
            and was sworn in as India’s 11th president, a largely ceremonial
            post, in July 2002. He left office at the end of his term in 2007
            and was succeeded by Pratibha Patil, the country’s first woman
            president.
